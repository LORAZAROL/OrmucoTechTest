# OrmucoTechTest

This is a solution for Ormuco technical test, including all three questions, QA, QB and QC

For QA and QB, each has an executable jar that can be run on console. 
- QA: type in `java -jar QA.jar` to start the program. And then follows the hint
- QB: type in `java -jar compareVersion.jar` to start the program. And then follows the hint.
  Unit(JUnit4) tests are attached in the test directory. All of them passed.

QC is a non-executable jar, including 2 classes: Cache and LRU_distributed. In general, they were similar to the traditional Client-Server structure, as the client requests data from the cache from my understanding. 

For all three questions, a series of JavaDoc is provided.
